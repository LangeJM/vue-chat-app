Notes:
1. when using general scripts you should use a main package.json file in the root project in order the run the inner scripts from the root (npm install, build, setup etc..)
2. Add .gitignore file in order the exclude some files such as package-lock.json and node-modules folders
3. out of the box there are compilation issues that prevent the app from running (file name was 'models/conversations.ts' instead of 'models/Conversations.ts')
